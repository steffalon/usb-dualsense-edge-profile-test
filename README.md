# USB DualSense Edge profile utility

The main objective of this project is to enable profile modifications, creation, and deletion for the DualSense Edge
controller. It aims to assist users in configuring joystick inputs, button mapping, and trigger registrations without
relying on a console.

### Functionality:
Currently, users can create and delete profiles on their DualSense Edge controller. Additional features are under
development.

### Why Node.js?
Node.js is a multiplatform environment and great for developing small-scale workflows. This project specifically focuses
on establishing USB "config" communication with the DualSense Edge controller without the need of a PS5 console.
